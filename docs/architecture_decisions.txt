Monlith service is decoupled in Persons service, Connection service, Location sevice.
Person and Connection are restful flask applications which helps to fetch persons and person locations.
Location Service is a GRPC serice which helps to capture near real time locations with profobuffs mechanism.

Capturing persons near real time location is very challenging with asynchronous REST services, so i decided to implement kafka technique
which allowed to put location data in message queue handled by producer and kafka consumer is ready to insert into postgresql db.
The most exciting part for me in this project is understanding kafka message queuing and implementing real time data.

Kafka server is helping location server to capture real time location data and grpc server is helping to get location protobuffs in real time.
Overall Client traffic management is well planned with the help of micro-service split, kafka and grpc.

persons API documentation can available @localhost:30002 and obviously location routes documentation is available @localhost:30001
